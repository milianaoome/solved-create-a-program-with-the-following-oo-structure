<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="Create a program with the following OO structure Solution">Create a program with the following OO structure – you do not have to implement any of the methods other than constructors to fill in some default data. You should implement the rest of the methods with a Console.WriteLine to indicate that it has been called.

Within a UNIVERSITY there are 4 DEPARTMENTSMATH, ENGLISH, GEOGRAPHY, COMPUTERSCIENCEEach DEPARTMENT has up to 10 STAFFThere is a DEAN, PROFESSORs, ADMINISTRATORs and RESEARCHERsAll Staff should have a name and salaryProfessors should have a ClassResearchers should have a ResearchSpeciality which is a fixed set of research areas represented by an enumerationDeans, Professors and Researchers should implement an ITeachable interface which contains the Teach() methodDeans and Administrators should implement an IAdmin interface which contains the Administrate() methodPay special attention to the IS-A relationships and the HAS-A relationships and implement things correctly.You should determine reasonable types for all properties not otherwise specified and initialise things with sensible defaults. Your constructors should have reasonable parameters to set up the type where you cannot simply use constants.var u = new University();Console.WriteLine(u.Department[2].Staff[3].Name);u.Department[1].Staff[0] = new Researcher(“Andy”);You should create additional test code to make sure that all of the properties and methods are available
